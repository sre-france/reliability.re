With the recent [announcement](https://news.itsfoss.com/mocaccinoos-announcement/) of Sabayon Linux becoming Mocaccino OS, we know that [Luet](https://luet-lab.github.io/docs/about/) will be used as package manager. This package manage sounds promising, with the ability to define your build / runtime dependencies on top of a container layer.
