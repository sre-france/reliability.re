If you don’t know how to start introducing SLOs at work, this a great example from Ioannis (@geototti21) and his journey to bring SLOs into his organization with a clear path and framework. As he said “Explain how SLOs can be an important internal tracking target that is tougher than your SLA. Also, mention how we can use the SLOs to offer better SLAs than “service uptime” if we are asked”
