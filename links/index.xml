&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting reading, since the question of Monolith vs modular applications is not &lt;em>easy&lt;/em> to answer and there is &lt;strong>no generic&lt;/strong> method to &lt;em>solve&lt;/em> it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So, we developed a new tool called Packwerk to analyze static constant references. [&amp;hellip;] We’re planning to make Packwerk open source soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m definitely looking for to see how they proceed and why not try to make it language agnostic.&lt;/p></description><rr:github>tormath1</rr:github><rr:twitter>tormath1</rr:twitter><rr:plain>Another feedback on RoR application migration @ Shopify with a long paper explaining the different steps / challenges (showing a few hints / IRL examples).
