This is the first part of a series of articles on how to debug Go programs in binary state using [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) and it's also a very good introduction to that kernel feature. By the way, I think eBPF will bring a lot of new observability tools, for example the new [Network Performance Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/network_performance_monitoring/installation/?tab=agent) of Datadog.
