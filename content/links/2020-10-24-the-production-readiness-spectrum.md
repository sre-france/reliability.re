If you're looking to adopt Production Readiness reviews, this is an insightful post from Pavlos blog (@dastergon), on it, he summarizes several aspects of Production Readiness reviews, like the spectrum from 1-sided to full automated reviews or examples of Production Readiness checklists from several companies, as well as what can the reviews bring to an organization: “Production Readiness Reviews are a powerful tool that enables us to provide a common language for our production standards across the organization. It increases our confidence throughout the whole lifecycle of a service and builds trust between product development and SRE teams”
