As part of our work on â€˜drittctlâ€™ we are writing a report on how infrastructure drift can be a challenge for DevOps teams, and how they address it. The goal is to share with the community core problems and best practices.
Here is a foretaste of this study, outlining some of the key facts we recorded.</em></p><p>When talking about infrastructure drift, you often get knowing glances and heated answers. Recording gaps in your infra between what you expected to be and the reality of what is, is a well known and wide spread issue bothering hundreds of teams around the globe. Facing impacts and consequences ranging from intensive toil to dangerous security threats, many team are keenly aware of the issue and actively looking for solutions.</p><p>We decided to look more closely into how they deal with it and conducted a study that will be released in the coming weeks.</p></div></main></body></html>
