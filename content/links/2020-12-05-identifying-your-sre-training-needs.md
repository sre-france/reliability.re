The best thing to create and facilitate the adoption of an SRE culture in your organization is to have an optimum training plan adapted to its size, maturity and people experience. Take a look inside chapter 1 of this @googlesre book as a good starting point to find a matrix describing different use cases for organizations of any size, and in chapter 3 you'll find case studies for small and large organizations that can inspire new ideas for your team!
