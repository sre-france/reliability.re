Another feedback on RoR application migration @ Shopify with a long paper explaining the different steps / challenges (showing a few hints / IRL examples).

It's an interesting reading, since the question of Monolith vs modular applications is not _easy_ to answer and there is **no generic** method to _solve_ it. 

> So, we developed a new tool called Packwerk to analyze static constant references. [...] We’re planning to make Packwerk open source soon. Stay tuned!

I'm definitely looking for to see how they proceed and why not try to make it language agnostic.
